query 1,Graph y equals x. ,y = x
query 1,Graph y equals x^2 - 3x and plot the intersection. ,"y = x^2 - 3x, (0, 0), (4, 4)"
query 2 ,Graph y = -2x^2 - 12x - 13,y = -2x^2 - 12x - 13
query 2 ,Graph y = -2x - 5 and find the intersection ,"y = -2x - 5, y = -2x^2 - 12x - 13, (-4, 3), (-1, 3)"
query 3 ,Plot y equals x - 2,y = x - 2
query 3 ,Plot the solution to the system with equation two as y equals x squared minus x minus five,"y = x - 2, y = x^2 - x - 5, (-1 , -3), (3, 1)"
query 4,Graph y equals negative three x over five plus three,y = -3x/5 + 3
query 4,Graph y equals the quantity x minus five times the quantity x minus three over five and show the intersection,"y = -3x/5 + 3, y = (x-5)(x-3/5), (0, 3), (5, 0)"
query 5,Plot x squared minus two x minus fifteen ,y = x^2 - 2x - 15
query 5,Also plot three x minus fifteen and plot the intersection,"y = x^2 - 2x - 15, y = 3x - 15, (0, -15), (5, 0)"
