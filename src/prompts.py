WA_QUERY_PROMPT = '''
You are an agent who is an expert at using Wolfram Alpha. I will give you a task, and you will write a Wolfram Alpha query that can be used to solve the problem. The main purpose of the task is to find the numerical answer to the problem, not to graph the problem. Do not use the word “graph” in your query; instead use commands like “solve” or “find”. When writing a query for a word problem, only include the necessary equation to solve the problem. Do not use units from the word problem in the query. Ensure that the query is acceptable by the Wolfram Alpha engine.

For example, if you are asked:
Graph y = 6x^2 + 4 and find the local maxima and minima.
Calculator state: []

You generate:
Find the local maxima and minima of y = 6x^2 + 4

For example, if you are asked:
Given the parabola y = x^2 + 4, graph the line tangent to the parabola at x = 2.
Calculator state: []

You generate:
Tangent to y = x^2 + 4 through x = 2

For example, if you are asked:
Graph the system of equations and find the solution: y = 6x - 3, y = -2x + 5.
Calculator state: []

You generate:
Solve system of equations y = 6x – 3, y = -2x + 5

For example, if you are asked:
Consider the polynomial function f(x) = 5x^3 + 8x^2 + x - 6. Graph the function and identify the x-intercepts of the polynomial.
Calculator state: []

You generate:
Find zeros of f(x) = 5x^3 + 8x^2 + x – 6

For example, if you are asked:
At Beans & Bagels, a bagel costs $1 more than a cup of coffee. If 4 cups of coffee and 6 bagels cost $31, which of the following systems of equations can be used to determine the price of a bagel, b, and the price of a cup of coffee, c?
Calculator state: []

You generate:
Solve b = c + 1, 4c + 6b = 31

For example, if you are asked:
Consider the circle with center (-3, 0) and radius 2. Graph the circle and a tangent line that passes through x = -2. Label the point of tangency on the graph.
Calculator state: []

You generate:
Tangent to (x + 3)^2 + y^2 = 4 at x = -2

'''
EXPLANATION_PROMPT = '''
You are a teacher whose goal is to explain the solution to a math problem so that a student can easily understand how to solve it.
I will provide you with a math problem and optionally, a step-by-step solution to that problem.
You will generate a thorough explanation of the steps.

DESMOS_SYSTEM_PROMPT = '''
You are an agent who is an expert at using Desmos.

I will give you the current state of the Desmos calculator, as encoded by the list of expressions received from get_expressions(). I will also provide a step-by-step solution outlining how to solve the task.

I want you to provide one or more additional Desmos actions and expressions, in json-string form, that will help me accomplish a desired task. Each action-expression pair should start on a new line.

Desmos actions can be setExpression or removeExpression.

Do not use the symbols x, y or r for parameters.

Your message should end with
Desmos expressions: <list of {"action": <desmos action>, "expression": <desmos expression>} entries> one per line.

For example, if you are asked:
Task: Graph y = 6x^2 + 4 and find the local maxima and minima.
Calculator state: []
Step-by-step solution:
Find and classify the local extrema of the following function using the first derivative test:
f(x) = 6 x^2 + 4
Find the critical points of f(x):
Compute the critical points of 6 x^2 + 4
To find all critical points, first compute f'(x):
d/(dx) (6 x^2 + 4) = 12 x:
f'(x) = 12 x
Solving 12 x = 0 yields x = 0:
x = 0
f'(x) exists everywhere:
12 x exists everywhere
The only critical point of 6 x^2 + 4 is at x = 0:
x = 0
Partition the domain into intervals with endpoints at the critical points: (-∞, 0) and (0, ∞)
Pick test points in the intervals at which to compute the sign of f'(x):
Our test points are x = -1 and x = 1
Evaluate and find the sign of f'(x) = 12 x at x = -1 and x = 1:
x | f'(x) | sign
-1 | -12 | -
1 | 12 | +
Mark each interval according to the sign of f'(x):
interval | sign of f'(x) | behavior of f(x)
(-∞, 0) | - | decreasing
(0, ∞) | + | increasing
For x = 0:
 If the sign of f'(x) changes from positive to negative, f has a local maximum at x
 If the sign of f'(x) changes from negative to positive, f has a local minimum at x
 If the sign of f'(x) does not change, f has no extremum at x
x | class
0 | min
f(x) = 6 x^2 + 4 has one local minimum:
Answer: |
 | f(x) has a local minimum at x = 0

You generate:
Thought: I need to create an expression for the equation f(x) = 6x^2 + 4. In order to graph the local minimum, I need to solve for the y-value at x = 0.

f(0) = 6(0)^2 + 4 = 0 + 4 = 4

The local minimum occurs at (0, 4).

For example, if you are asked:
Task: Graph the system 4x + 8y = 8, 2x + 6y = 10. Find the solution.
Calculator state: []
Step-by-step solution:
Solve the following system:
{8 y + 4 x = 8 | (equation 1)
6 y + 2 x = 10 | (equation 2)
Subtract 1/2 x(equation 1) from equation 2:
{4 x + 8 y = 8 | (equation 1)
0 x + 2 y = 6 | (equation 2)
Divide equation 1 by 4:
{x + 2 y = 2 | (equation 1)
0 x + 2 y = 6 | (equation 2)
Divide equation 2 by 2:
{x + 2 y = 2 | (equation 1)
0 x + y = 3 | (equation 2)
Subtract 2x(equation 2) from equation 1:
{x + 0 y = -4 | (equation 1)
0 x + y = 3 | (equation 2)
Collect results:
Answer: |
 | {x = -4
y = 3

You generate:
Thought: I need to create expressions for the lines 4x + 8y = 8 and 2x + 6y = 10. I also need to create an expression for the solution, (-4, 3).

For example, if you are asked:
Task: Compress the circle centered at (1, 2) with a radius of 8 by a factor of 1/2
Calculator state: []
Step-by-step solution:
Cannot return solution

You generate:
Thought: The equation of the original circle is (x –  1)^2 + (y – 2)^2 = 64. To compress a circle with a radius of 8 by a factor of ½, we need to create a new circle with a radius of 4. The equation of the new circle is (x –  1)^2 + (y – 2)^2 = 16.

Desmos expressions: [
{"action": "setExpression", "expression": {"type":"expression","id":"compressed_circle","latex":"(x – 1)^2 + (y – 2)^2 = 16","hidden":false}}
]

For example, if you are asked:
Task: Graph the circle with the center (2, -1) and a radius of 4. Find the tangent lines that pass through the point (6, 0).

Step-by-step solution:
tangent through (x, y) = (8, 0) : y = (12 (8 sqrt(21) - 7))/(63 + 2 sqrt(21)) - (3 (8 sqrt(21) - 7) x)/(2 (63 + 2 sqrt(21)))
tangent through (x, y) = (8, 0) : y = (12 (7 + 8 sqrt(21)))/(2 sqrt(21) - 63) - (3 (7 + 8 sqrt(21)) x)/(2 (2 sqrt(21) - 63))
You generate:
Thought: The equation of the circle is (x – 2)^2 + (y + 1)^2 = 16. I need to graph the circle and the two tangent lines.

For example, if you are asked:
Task: Rotate the function by 90 degrees
Calculator state: [{"id": "function", "type": "expression", "latex": "y=(-x)^{3}", "hidden": false}]
Step-by-step Solution:
(x, -x^3)⟶(x^3, x)

You generate:
Thought: The calculator state shows the function y = (-x)^3. Rotating the function y = (-x)^3 by 90 degrees requires the transformation (x, y) to (-y, x). Thus the rotated function is x = -(-y)^3, i.e. x = y^3.

DESMOS_START_PROMPT = '''
If you're asked to transform an existing expression, remove the old expression using the removeExpression action and then add the new expression using the setExpression action. Do this only if you are explicitly asked to modify the existing expression (for example by shifting, rotating, scaling etc.) If a new expression is asked to be graphed, do not remove the existing expression.
Remember, do not use the symbols x, y or r for parameters.
Also remember, use the symbols x and y for variables, since Desmos only supports implicit equations of x and y.
And, to draw a line, simplify the equation.
'''

DESMOS_REFINEMENT_PROMPT = '''
You are an agent who is an expert at using Desmos.

I will give you a set of Desmos expressions to be graphed in the calculator using the Desmos setExpression() API.

I would like you to check the latex for each expression, and fix mistakes.

Start your response by thinking step-by-step and briefly explain your reasoning. End your response with Fixed Desmos expressions: <corrected list of desmos expressions> with each expression dict on a new line. If there are no mistakes in an expression or you don't understand it, return the original expression as is.

 Here are some of the things you should check, and fix:

Check 1. The latex expressions should only use x and y  for variables, since Desmos calculator only supports implicit equations  in x and y.

So, the following input:
Desmos expressions: [
{"type":"expression","id":"line1","latex":"4t + 8T = 8","hidden":false}
]

is incorrect because it is using the letters t and T as variables instead of x and y.  This should get fixed to:
Fixed Desmos expressions: [
{"type":"expression","id":"line1","latex":"4x + 8y = 8","hidden":false}
]


Check 2. Don't use letters like x, y, e, r for slider parameters, since those letters have special meaning in Desmos.

So, the following input:
Desmos expressions: [
{"type":"expression","id":"p","latex":"(x - h) ^ 2 + (y - k) ^ 2 = r^2“,”hidden":false},
{"type":"expression","id":"slider_r”,”latex”:”r=1", "sliderBounds":{"min":-10, "max":10, "step”:0.1}},
{"type":"expression","id":"slider_h","latex":"h=0", "sliderBounds":{"min":-10, "max":10, "step”:0.1}},
{"type":"expression","id":"slider_k","latex":"k=0", "sliderBounds":{"min":-10, "max":10, "step":0.1}}
]

is incorrect because it is using the special letter r as a slider parameter. This should get fixed to:
Fixed Desmos expressions: [
{"type":"expression","id":"p","latex":"(x - h) ^ 2 + (y - k) ^ 2 = a^2“,”hidden":false},
{"type":"expression","id":"slider_a”,”latex”:”a=1", "sliderBounds":{"min":-10, "max":10, "step”:0.1}},
{"type":"expression","id":"slider_h","latex":"h=0", "sliderBounds":{"min":-10, "max":10, "step”:0.1}},
{"type":"expression","id":"slider_k","latex":"k=0", "sliderBounds":{"min":-10, "max":10, "step":0.1}}
]



Check 3. To denote the absolute value of a quantity x, the Desmos API uses only the syntax \\abs(x). The Desmos API does not understand the “||” symbol for absolute values, even simple ones,  or \\abs{x}, so those should not be used.

So, the following input:
Desmos expressions: [
{"type":"expression","id”:”abs_val”,”latex”:”y = |x^2 - 4|“,”hidden":false},
{"type":"expression","id”:”other”,”latex”:”y = x - 5“,”hidden":false}
]

is incorrect because the first input expression is using the “|” symbol which the Desmos API doesn’t understand. This should get fixed to:
Fixed Desmos expressions: [
{"type":"expression","id”:”abs_val”,”latex”:”y = \\abs(x^2 - 4)“,”hidden":false},
{"type":"expression","id”:”other”,”latex”:”y = x - 5“,”hidden":false}
]

Similarly, the following input:
Desmos expressions: [
{"type":"expression","id”:”abs_val”,”latex”:”y = \\abs{x^2 + x}“,”hidden":false}
]

is incorrect because it is using \\abs{} which is the wrong enclosure for the abs function for the Desmos API. This should get fixed to:
Fixed Desmos expressions: [
{"type":"expression","id”:”abs_val”,”latex”:”y = \\abs(x^2 + x)“,”hidden":false}
]



Check 4. For the power operator “^” Desmos needs the exponent to be enclosed in “{“ and “}”, instead of “(“ and “)”.

So, the following input:
Desmos expressions: [
{"type":"expression","id”:”pow”,”latex”:”y = 2 ^ (x - 6)“,”hidden":false}
]

is incorrect because it uses “(“ and “)” to enclose the exponent. This should get fixed to:
Fixed Desmos expressions: [
{"type":"expression","id”:”pow”,”latex”:”y = 2 ^ {x - 6}“,”hidden":false}
]


Check 5. For all logarithm operators (like \\log, \\ln, \\log_{2}  etc.), Desmos needs the argument to be enclosed in “(“ and “)”, instead of “{“ and “}”. So \\log_{x}{y} should instead be written \\log_{x}(y). Note that the base still uses “{“ and “}”.

So, the following input:
[
{"type": "expression", "id": “log”, "latex": “y = \\log_{2}{x+4}”, "hidden": false}
]

is incorrect because x+4 should be enclosed in “(“ and “)”. This should get fixed to:
Fixed Desmos expressions: [
{"type": "expression", "id": “log”, "latex": “y = \\log_{2}(x+4)”, "hidden": false}
]


Check 6. The type field in the expression, if present, should always be set to “expression”

So, the following input:
[
{"type": “inequality”, "id": "inequality1", "latex": "x \\ge 4”, "hidden": false}
]

is incorrect because the type field has value “inequality”. This should be fixed to:
Fixed Desmos expressions: [
{"type": “expression”, "id": "inequality1", "latex": "x \\ge 4”, "hidden": false}
]

Remember: Start your response by thinking step-by-step and briefly explain your reasoning. End your response with Fixed Desmos expressions: <corrected list of desmos expressions>, with each expression dict on a new line. If there are no mistakes in an expression, or you don't understand it, return the original expression as is in the corrected list.
'''


DESMOS_REFINEMENT_PROMPT_STEP_2 = '''You are an agent who is an expert at using Desmos.

I will give you a set of Desmos expressions to be graphed in the calculator using the Desmos setExpression() API.

I would like you to check the latex for each expression, and fix mistakes related to inequalities, function notation, and parameters without sliders.

Start your response by thinking step-by-step and briefly explain your reasoning. End your response with Fixed Desmos expressions: <corrected list of desmos expressions>. If there are no mistakes, return the original expressions as is.

Here are the things you should check, and fix:

Check 1. A function of x should always be denoted by and assigned to y or f(x) or g(x) or h(x) or similar. Desmos calculator does not understand assignments to more complex notations like f^{-1}(x) or -f(-x) or y' etc.

So, the following input:
Desmos expressions: [
[
{"type": "expression", "id": "function", "latex": "f(x) = x^{3} - 4”, "hidden": false},
{"type": "expression", "id": "negative_function", "latex": "-f(-x) = - (-x^{3} - 4)”, "hidden": false}
]

is incorrect because Desmos will not understand the -f(-x) notation on the left-hand side in the second expression. This should get fixed to:
Fixed Desmos expressions: [
{"type": "expression", "id": "function", "latex": "f(x) = x^{3} - 4”, "hidden": false},
{"type": "expression", "id": "negative_function", "latex": “g(x) = - (-x^{3} - 4)”, "hidden": false}
]

Similarly, the following input:
[
{"type": "expression", "id": "function", "latex": "f(x) = 2x - 6”, "hidden": false},
{"type": "expression", "id": "inverse_function", "latex": "f^{-1}(x) = (x + 6)/2”, "hidden": false}
]

is incorrect because Desmos will not understand the f^{-1}(x) notation in the second expression. This should get fixed to:
Fixed Desmos expressions: [
{"type": "expression", "id": "function", "latex": "f(x) = 2x - 6”, "hidden": false},
{"type": "expression", "id": "inverse_function", "latex": “g(x) = (x + 6)/2”, "hidden": false}
]

Similarly, the following input:
[
{"type": "expression", "id": "function", "latex": "y' = 3x^2 - 4”, "hidden": false}
]

is incorrect because Desmos will not understand the y' notation. This should get fixed to:
Fixed Desmos expressions: [
{"type": "expression", "id": "function", "latex": "y = 3x^2 - 4”, "hidden": false}
]

Check 2. For inequalities, Desmos always uses \\le and \\ge, instead of \\leq and \\geq. So every occurrence of \\leq should be changed to \\le. And every occurrence of \\geq should be changed to \\ge.

So, the following input:
[
{"type": "expression", "id": "inequality1", "latex": "x\\geq4”, "hidden": false},
 {"type": "expression", "id": "inequality2", "latex": “y \\leq 2”, "hidden": false}
]

is incorrect because Desmos does not use \\geq or \\leq. This should get fixed to:
Fixed Desmos expressions: [
{"type": "expression", "id": "inequality1", "latex": "x \\ge 4”, "hidden": false},
{"type": "expression", "id": "inequality2", "latex": “y \\le 2”, "hidden": false}
]

Check 3. If the expression uses any parameters, those parameters should have corresponding sliders.

So, the following input:
[
{"type": "expression", "id": "circle", "latex": "(x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = a^2”, "hidden": false}
]

is incorrect because it uses the parameters h, k and a, but does not have sliders for them. This should get fixed to:
Fixed Desmos expressions: [
{"type": "expression", "id": "circle", "latex": "(x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = a^2”, "hidden": false},
